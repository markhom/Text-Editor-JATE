## Features

- **Client-Server Structure**: The application follows a client-server architecture with separate folders for client and server code.
- **Webpack Bundling**: JavaScript files are bundled using Webpack, optimizing performance and compatibility.
- **Webpack Plugins**: Utilizes plugins to generate an HTML file, service worker, and manifest file for the application.
- **Next-Gen JavaScript**: Incorporates modern JavaScript features for efficient and clean code.
- **IndexedDB Storage**: Utilizes IndexedDB to store text editor content, allowing data persistence even after closing the application.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Allows users to install the application on their desktop for a native-like experience.
- **Service Worker with Workbox**: Registers a service worker to pre-cache static assets and enable offline functionality.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the root directory**:

    ```bash
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the application**:

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

    This command starts up the backend and serves the client.

## Usage

- **Opening the Application**: Access the application in your browser or through your desktop if installed as a PWA.
- **Text Editing**: Enter content in the text editor. Your changes will be automatically saved using IndexedDB when you click off the DOM window.
- **Persistent Storage**: Any content entered in the text editor will be retrieved from IndexedDB when you reopen the application.
- **Service Worker**: A service worker is registered to pre-cache static assets, enabling fast loading and offline support.
